# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

This repository serves to showcase my work in completing the Module 3 Challenge of my edX Bootcamp. 

The challenge was to re-create my portfolio site, from the Module 2 Challenge. 

As opposed to the following screenshots that provided a Demo for a portfolio (with an example of the appropriate appearance and functionality for the application. I made adapatations from this to make my own portfolio individual to me: 

![Demo1](/images/Screenshot1.png)

![Demo2](/images/Screenshot2.png)

The required features of the site were as follows:

A Navigation bar
-A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML.
-Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
-Links should navigate to the appropriate sections

A hero section
-A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

A work section
-A section displaying your work in grid.

Use bootstrap cards for each project.
The description should give a brief overview of the work.
Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

A skills section
-List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

An about / contact section.
-An "About Me" section in the same row.

A footer section.
-All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
-All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.


I have, also, included a CV section in my header (though this was beyond the minimum required features for this challenge). I will include a link to my CV, as I update this portfolio overtime.
